# Instagram Follower Scraper
> Scrapes all the followers from instagram pages and stores them in a csv file

_The scraper uses the awesome library [Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io/) to get data from instagram._
_This doesn't use the instagram API because it is slow and has other limitations. Please don't run multiples instances of this scraper at same time from same device._
